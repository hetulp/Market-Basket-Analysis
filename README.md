# Market-Basket-Analysis

Market basket analysis based on frequency

# Scenario

The system will look at the products the customer has placed in their online shopping cart and recommend another product.

# Constraints

• Limited individual sales to no more than 1 of each product
• Temporal reasoning should not be considered (time and date of the sale should not be considered)
• Use of simple frequency count for recommendations

# Data
• Training set has 1 million records
• Testing set has 100 records

# Output
• csv file, which contains one recommended item for 100 records
